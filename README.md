# Moncity-Data-Warehousing-SQL-PowerBI

MonCity is one of the largest smart cities in the world, and was developed by Monash University for education and research purposes. In MonCity, there are four different zone areas (ZoneA, ZoneB, ZoneC, ZoneD). A wide range of self-driving cars is provided for Monash students and staff members to travel between different zone areas or within the same zone area.
MonCity has an existing operational database that maintains and stores all of the self-driving car-related information, such as the booking, maintenance, and accident records required for management's daily operation. However, in order to improve work efficiency, management at MonCity has decided to hire your team of data warehouse engineers to design and develop a data warehouse that can quickly generate reports based on their needs. Management at MonCity wants to generate reports to keep track of the bookings, accidents and maintenance information, such as calculating statistics of booking records and accident records, which can be used for self-driving car analyses later. For the accident details, they are particularly interested in the number of accidents per self-driving car (e.g., the number of accidents caused by Car01).
